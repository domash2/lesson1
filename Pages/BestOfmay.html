<p><strong>CHILDHOOD WONDER</strong>  This picture of Your Shot photographer Vironica Golden's son tells a very personal story. "After years of infertility I feel very lucky that we were able to conceive with the help of IVF," she says.
   "Having children made me change the way I see the world; ordinary things become extraordinary in the eyes of children.</br> PHOTOGRAPH BY VIRONICA GOLDEN"

<p><strong>RAINS IN AFRICA</strong> An African lion waits out the rain. Sadly, in the past 20 years, the African lion population has decreased by 42 percent.
   Much of this decline can be attributed to humans encroaching on lions' territory and hunting them for sport. <br>

<p> <strong>DANCING SUNSET</strong> The northern lights combine with a sunset to make a beautiful landscape photograph. The Lofoten Islands of Norway, where this shot was taken, are a picturesque place to see the lights from September to April. <br>

<p><strong>DAILY CATCH</strong> Your Shot photographer Navtej Singh captured an old tradition with a new angle. Of the action below, he writes, "This is an early morning fish auction, when the boats come in after night fishing at Bhaucha Dhakka, Mumbai. The catch is offloaded by the boat managers and auctioned in lots to the highest bidder, who further sells the same in small lots to small-time fish sellers." <br>
