<h1>The wonder of water</h1>

<p>WANAKA, NEW ZEALAND"I had heard so much about this famous tree and thought that
   so many people had photographed it that there was no point in doing so myself.
    That was until I saw it on this glorious early morning and was drawn to taking
    my own creation of this." <br>
PHOTOGRAPH BY LINDA CUTCHE</p>

<img src="/Users/domash/Desktop/lesson1/images/The wonder of water/geese-canastota-new-york.adapt.885.1.jpg" width="100%">

<p>CANASTOTA, NEW YORK"The only sound throughout the swamp on this late spring morning
  were three geese honking at one another. They gathered at the head of the lake, where
   a fog bank rolled in just as the sun peaked over the trees to wrap the area in an ethereal glow.
   As I watched, the goose in the center of the trio pivoted toward the sun and, as if
   in greeting, arched out of the water and flapped its wings." <br>

<img src="/Users/domash/Desktop/lesson1/images/The wonder of water/moraine-lake-view-canda.adapt.885.1.jpg" width="100%">

<p>ALBERTA, CANADA"My best ever travel experience. I was desperate to come back
   to Moraine Lake because I had been here twice before as a child on holiday
   and it had become my favourite memory. Coming back as an adult meant
   I was able to finally capture in person the views that I'd always seen on
    postcards and when a woman came to just sit and wonder at the incredible view
     I knew I had a good shot. The combination of the sheer beauty of Canada and fulfilling
      a personal dream made this shot my personal favourite." <br>
