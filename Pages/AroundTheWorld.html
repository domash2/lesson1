<p>"A powerful eruption of Colima Volcano in Mexico on December 13, 2015. That night, the weather was dry and cold, friction of ash particles generated lightning of about 600 meters that connected ash and volcano, and illuminated most of the dark scene. In 2015, this volcano showed a lot of eruptive activity with ash explosions that raised 2-3 km above the crater. Most of the night explosions produced incandescent rockfalls and lightning no bigger than 100 meters on average." – Sergio Tapiro Velasco <br>

<p>"This is Cheia, a road that takes you to Transylvania. Yes, THAT Transylvania, the birthplace of the legendary Count Dracula. The legend is that this shot is what he might have seen on his nocturnal flights! Nevertheless, it's a breathtaking view of a magnificent road." – Calin Stan <br>

<p>"The afternoon light couldn't of been more perfect as I quietly sat and watched this crocodile survey his dinner. The patterns the reflections made in the afternoon sun were stunning and the moment was so tranquil. There were no indications of the ferocity to come as the crocodile devoured his meal." – Alison Langevad <br>

 <p>"I was cruising in a zodiac along the Antarctic Peninsula when we encountered this adelie penguin walking up a steep iceberg. I quickly composed the photo as we approached the iceberg before veering off past the penguin. I had time for six photos in succession before we passed by the iceberg and cruised through the iceberg-laden waters." – Larry Malvin <br>
